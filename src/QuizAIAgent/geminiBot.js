    Your goal is to return a JSON array of answers for a batch of questions. You must follow these rules strictly:
    
    1. Match each answer to the corresponding question using its "id".
    2. Only choose from the "options" or "opts" provided for each question â€” do NOT invent new IDs or values.
    3. Use the exact "value" fields from the options given.
    4. Return the final output in the specified answer format (see below). Do NOT include explanations or formatting like markdown or extra text.
    5. Don't skip any question, even if there's a question which requires referring to an image or additional information, make the best guess from its given options.
